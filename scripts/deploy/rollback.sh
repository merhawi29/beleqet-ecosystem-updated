# rollback.sh — restore the previous healthy container image set
#
# Usage: rollback.sh <failing-sha>
#
# Reads the last recorded successful SHA, validates it (full 40-hex, distinct
# from the failing SHA — same rules as tools/ci/rollback.ts), rewrites the
# image references, restarts the stack, and re-checks backend health.
#
# CONTAINERS ONLY: the database is never rolled back here. Prisma migrations
# are roll-forward; the pre-migration backup made by deploy-staging.sh is the
# manual recovery path for schema damage.
#
# Exit codes: 0 rolled back and healthy · 1 no usable rollback target ·
# 4 rollback applied but health check still failing
# =============================================================================
