 *
 * This is the loose-coupling seam the architecture calls for: the AI never sees
 * the database schema, and Resume Brain never writes to the DB — it only
 * prepares data in the shape UserService already accepts. Only non-empty fields
 * are emitted, so a partial extraction never blanks out data the user already
 * has on their profile.
